## Rules

"Black colour" : Death
"White colour" : Life

The box of pixels (cells) of the screen represent the cells in the Game of Life. Clicking a cell will turn it black. White cells represent "living" cells.
Living and dead cells will change over time, following the rules of Conway's Game of Life:

1.>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2.>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3.>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
